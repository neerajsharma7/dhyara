				<h1 class="heading" style="font-size:40px;">How to Remove a Tattoo Quickly</h1> <br />
				Tattoos are said to be forever as they serve as a symbol of our beliefs as well as many great passions in life. It is one such art that has been embraced by people of all ages. From teenagers to pensioners, everyone welcomes this art with open arms. In fact, there are millions of people who have some kind of design imprinted in ink on their skin. But as the popularity of tattoos increasing worldwide, another thing that has also been developed is the tattoo removal methods. To successfully remove a tattoo, you need to understand that removing a tattoo at home is a time taking process and some of the methods available in the market can harm you. So always choose whatâ€™s best for you and not simply go with the recommendations from friends or family. <br /> <br />

				<h2 class="heading" style="font-size:30px; float:left; color: #000;">Topical At-home Tattoo Removal Methods</h2> <br /> <br /> <br />
				Topical remedies are for all those people who are looking for a safe and secure way to naturally remove the tattoo. These remedies contain natural remedies and creams which lighten the tattoo, when using repeatedly. These methods are considered much safer than Salabrasion or Dermabrasion that does not always give the desired results and in some cases leave scars on the skin. <br /> <br />
				So it is preferable to go for Topical methods like Creams that are designed specifically to remove tattoos. Though using these tattoo removal creams can cause skin problems like minor skin irritation, discoloration while in some cases, blistering of the skin too. There are other topical treatments too, like Chemical peel, which is quite painful and is not that safe to use. <br /> <br />

				<h2 class="heading" style="font-size:30px; float:left; color: #000;">Salabrasion / Dermabrasion Method to Remove Tattoos at Home</h2> <br /> <br /> <br />
				Salabrasion is an old and effective tattoo removal method that has been used for centuries and is also considered as the most painful ways to remove unwanted tattoo. It is recommended for only those people who have a high threshold for pain. The good thing about this method is that it is effective, affordable, fairly simple and can easily be done at home. But there are disadvantages of using this method too, as patients can get unsightly scars and infections, which can delay tattoo removal process and can make the process even more time-taking and painful. <br /> <br />
				In fact, doctors even claim that going for Salabrasion/ Dermabrasion is almost like throwing Kerosene on the tattoo and lighting a fire on it. And I am sure this reason is strong enough to make you think twice about this method and to consider many others safe and effective options to remove tattoo at home. <br /> <br />

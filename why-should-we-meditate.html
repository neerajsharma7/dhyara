					<h3 class="heading" style="font-size:40px;">Why should we meditate?</h3> <br />					
					Meditation is an activity that can help us connect with our inner selves which usually gets lost in our busy everyday life. Each day we are exposed to so many types of emotions and stimulus in our lives that we are sometimes not able to handle them. Therefore meditation is the right tool that helps us keep calm and understand things in a better way. Following seven points highlights the benefits of meditation that can change your life immensely in a positive way.
					<br /> <br />					
					<p class="topic-heading">1. Connect to your inner self</p>
					When you meditate, you attain a level of awareness of your own self and go deeper into understanding your inner emotions, desires and even fears. Meditation helps you to understand your inner self so that you can connect to it in a better way which further leads to happiness.
					<p class="topic-heading">2. Connects you to spirituality</p>
					Meditation helps you connect to spirituality by making your senses more active and advanced. Through meditation, you can work on improving your sixth sense and intuition which is very beneficial for living a fruitful life. Hence leading to a more happy and satisfying relationship with your loved ones.
					<p class="topic-heading">3. Refreshes you</p>
					When you go deeper into meditation, you are totally conscious of your subconscious state. However, at the same time, you are detaching yourself from the outside world. This leads to great relaxation of mind and when you are out of meditation, you feel refreshed and rejuvenated. This helps in improving the quality of your work and family life tremendously.
					<p class="topic-heading">4. Cures sleeplessness</p>
					Meditation can also help people who suffer from the problem of sleeplessness. Since it calms down the mind as well as the body, you feel more relaxed when you go to bed. Normally, sleeplessness happens when mind and body are too active and cannot be put to rest. In this scenario, meditation can provide the best cure for it.
					<p class="topic-heading">5. Inspires you</p>
					Apart from all the benefits, meditation also inspires you to become a better person and take the next higher steps in life. Usually, your mind or the society might tell you that you cannot do the impossible but by meditating regularly, you can actually explore your own inner strength and nurture it to achieve big things in life. Hence you are never scared of new challenges and opportunities in life.
					<p class="topic-heading">6. Helps you live in the moment</p>
					Living in the moment is very important if you want to reach the state of constant happiness. As humans, we tend to dwell a lot in the past as well as worry about things that could go wrong in future. But meditation helps you take a step back and get an outsider’s view about your life. You may realize that it is more important to live in the present and enjoy the moments with your loved ones. The future is definitely unknown so you cannot change it by worrying about it. These are some of the things meditation helps you understand in a better way.
					<p class="topic-heading">7. Keeps you grounded</p>
					Most importantly, meditation keeps you grounded to reality. This is something most of us forget while living out lives. If you have the best job or the best cars and a loving family, it doesn’t mean you have the right to look down upon others. One must never think that they are greater than all others around them. It is very important that we understand that there can be others who are better than us and also many others who are in worse situation than us. Despite your situation in life, you need to be grounded and humble. Meditation helps us in being humble because we go into our inner selves and realize our own fears and shortcomings. This helps in embracing what we have by being aware of the reality.
					<br /> <br />
					<b><i>Meditation definitely has many benefits but the above mentioned seven benefits are the most important of all. It can help you in leading a happier and better quality life. Meditation not only has positive effects on the brain but also on your body. It is the key for a healthy mind and body relationship. Start meditation today and you will see its benefits very clearly in your own life.</i></b>

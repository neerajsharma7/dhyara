				Everybody finds a beer to be a highly refreshing and relaxing drink but most of us wouldn't believe it to be used as a handy alternative for a variety of common household dilemmas. So what are you waiting for?! Let us discuss them right here:
				<h2 class="topic-heading">Hair Softener Shampoo</h2>
				We have come across many interesting uses of beer, most common of all being shampooing. Use it as a regular hair shampoo to give it a bounce before you hit a party. <br />
				<b><i>Tip : </i></b>For shampooing, stick to the traditional beer bottle method rather than going for the commercial beer shampoo products available in the market.
				<br /> <br />
				<h2 class="topic-heading">Skin Conditioning, NO Kidding!</h2>
				For those who are unaware of the soothing nature of beer, here's the trick for you. Using beer as a skin conditioner is not something practiced too often. Though applying it directly on your body wouldn't really help, alternatively, you can simply fill a bathtub full of water and dilute a beer bottle and enjoy a good conditioning session.
				<br /> <br />
				<h2 class="topic-heading">Marinate Meat And Mushrooms Better</h2>
				Even the most difficult conundrums can be solved with this simple beverage. Due to its acidic nature and an ideal tinge of taste, beer works as the perfect marinating base replacing buttermilk the world over.
